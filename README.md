# Vanilla Overhaul Mod

## Change Log
The following are the changes that you will find in this mod, these changes are small and can be ignored if you want!

### Changes
- **Rotten Leather:** Rotten Flesh can be smelted in any furnace into Leather.
- **Mangrove Roots to Log:** Using 4 Mangrove Roots you can craft 1 Mangrove Log, as the Roots (as of 1.19) can only be used as a fuel
- **Moss to Grass:** Using 1 Moss Carpet and 1 Dirt block you can craft a Grass block.
- **Compressed Blocks:** Can craft a compressed version of some blocks, from 4 of the original. Incredibly useful for mass storage units! 
  - Dirt
  - Cobblestone
  - Granite
  - Diorite
  - Andesite
  - Tuff
  - Sand
  - Gravel
  - Cobbled Deepslate
  - Netherrack
  - Basalt
  - Blackstone

### Optional Changes
Optional changes are disabled by default, but can be enabled inside this mod's configuration file, but changing the associated value from `false` to `true`.
- **Unbreakable Items:** Whenever you attempt to damage an item, it will instantly become unbreakable. This is quite an OP feature, but is good if you dont want to worry about having mending.
  - Config ID: `unbreakableItems`
- **Increased Rare Loot Chance:** Yes it is cheating. But modding is cheating so I'll allow it.
  - Blaze Rods = 50%
    - Config ID: `blazeRodChance`
  - Ender Pearls = 50%
    - Config ID: `enderPearlChance`
  - Wither Skulls = 10%
    - Config ID: `witherSkeletonSkullChance`

### Future Changes

I have no changes in mind! Please suggest some <3
