# Fabric Example Mod

## Change Log
The following are the changes that you will find in this mod, these changes are small and can be ignored if you want!

### Changes
- **Rotten Leather:** Rotten Flesh can be smelted in any furnace into Leather.
- **Mangrove Roots to Log:** Using 4 Mangrove Roots you can craft 1 Mangrove Log, as the Roots (as of 1.19) can only be used as a fuel

### Optional Changes
Optional changes are disabled by default, but can be enabled inside this mod's configuration file, but changing the associated value from `false` to `true`.
- **Unbreakable Items:** Whenever you attempt to damage an item, it will instantly become unbreakable. This is quite an OP feature, but is good if you dont want to worry about having mending.
  - Config ID: `unbreakableItems`

### Future Changes
The following are changes that I plan to add in the future, let me know if there are any of your changes that you think I should add!
- **Moss to Grass:** Using 1 Moss Carpet and 1 Dirt block you can craft a Grass block.
