### Optional Changes
Optional changes are disabled by default, but can be enabled inside this mod's configuration file, but changing the associated value from `false` to `true`.
- **Unbreakable Items:** Whenever you attempt to damage an item, it will instantly become unbreakable. This is quite an OP feature, but is good if you dont want to worry about having mending.
